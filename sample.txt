Paratext is a term used in literary theory to describe the material that surrounds a published text, such as the cover art, title, front matter, back matter, and other elements that are not part of the main text itself. This paratext can greatly influence how readers interpret and engage with the text, as it sets the tone and provides context for the story or information being presented.Graphoc DFGrd fdhgdhghdfh
